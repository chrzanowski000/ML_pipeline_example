This project implements a production-grade PyTorch ML pipeline with:
- data integrity validation
- MLflow experiment tracking & registry
- acceptance-criteria-based validation
- frozen, versioned model artifacts
- production-safe FastAPI inference

The pipeline is designed to reflect GxP-style requirements:
reproducibility, traceability, and controlled model release.
